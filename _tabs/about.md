# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
Welcome to my corner of the internet! Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for tackling challenges and unraveling complex puzzles. My journey into the world of cybersecurity began with a fascination for technology and a desire to understand how things work beneath the surface.

Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like Hack The Box. These hands-on experiences not only sharpen my skills but also fuel my excitement for the field. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and think critically, and I thrive on the adrenaline that comes from solving tough problems.

This blog is primarily focused on my preparation for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. Iâ€™ll be sharing my insights, study strategies, and resources that I find helpful along the way. Whether youâ€™re a fellow aspiring OSCP candidate, a seasoned professional, or just curious about cybersecurity, I hope you find something valuable here.

Join me on this journey as I explore the intricacies of penetration testing, share tips for navigating CTFs, and document my progress toward achieving the OSCP. Letâ€™s connect, learn, and grow together in this ever-evolving field!

Feel free to reach out or leave commentsâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Happy hacking!
