# Sniper - Hack The Box Walkthrough

|Machine|Release Date |Operating System|Difficulty|
--------|-------------|----------------|----------|
|Sniper|05 Oct, 2019 |Windows         |Medium      |


## About the Machine

Sniper is a medium-difficulty Windows-based machine that revolves around a PHP server. The server hosts a vulnerable file susceptible to both local and remote file inclusion (LFI/RFI). By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can achieve command execution on the server under the NT AUTHORITY\iUSR context through the inclusion of specially crafted PHP session files. Exposed database credentials further enable the attacker to log in as the user Chris, who shares the same password. During enumeration, it is discovered that the administrator is reviewing CHM (Compiled HTML Help) files, which can be exploited to leak the administrator's NetNTLMv2 hash. This hash can then be captured, cracked, and used to obtain a reverse shell as the administrator via a PowerShell credential object.

### SMB Enumeration

Guest account seems to be disabled and we are unable to enumerate shares in the target.

```
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/sniper]
└─$ netexec smb 10.129.229.6 -u 'guest' -p '' --shares
SMB         10.129.229.6    445    SNIPER           [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 x64 (name:SNIPER) (domain:Sniper) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.229.6    445    SNIPER           [-] Sniper\guest: STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED
```

### IIS Website

Initial look at the website, it seems that it belongs to a delivery business.

It is hosted on an IIS Server and for backend, `PHP/7.3.1 ` is used.

On the login page `http://10.129.229.6/user/login.php`, there is an option to sign-in.

I created an account but then when I tried to login with it, I got the following error:

If you look at the blogs, each page is same except for the language part:
1. http://10.129.229.6/blog/?lang=blog-en.php
2. http://10.129.229.6/blog/?lang=blog-en.php
3. http://10.129.229.6/blog/?lang=blog-fr.php

Also notice that there is LFI. PHP is basically calling file
