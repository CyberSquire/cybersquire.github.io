## AD CS Enumeration

### From a windows host

If you have RSAT installed on the client machine, it is very easy to enumerate AD CS since almost everyone in the domain has read permissions on most of the containers in Active Directory. This is because the `Authenticated Users` group by default will have `Read` permission on almost every container in Active Directory.

Using the following command, you can check if there is a group called `Cert Publishers` present and also enumerate its members. This is the built-in container and includes all enterprise certification authorities.

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Cert Publishers'

distinguishedName : CN=DC01,OU=Domain Controllers,DC=lab,DC=lcl
name              : DC01
objectClass       : computer
objectGUID        : c2d349fb-81df-4e2a-97b2-551a70de4aaa
SamAccountName    : DC01$
SID               : S-1-5-21-238413464-3472519285-2711372490-1000
```

If you do not like CLI and would rather prefer using a GUI, `ADSI Edit` can be used. Going through the `Public Key Services container` container will give a lot of information about the PKI which is quite difficult (not impossible) using CLI.

All ADCS-related containers reside within the configuration naming context under the Public Key Services container :

`CN=Public Key Services, CN=Services, CN=Configuration, DC={forest root domain}`

> `ADSI Edit` is an administrative tool and is part of Active Directory RSAT Tools.

We could also use `Certify` which is a C# tool to enumerate and abuse misconfigurations in Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).

 Since the authors do not plan on releasing binaries, we will have to compile ourselves. Certify has been built against .NET 4.0 and is compatible with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. Simply open up the project .sln, choose "Release", and build.

Once the binary is ready, we can use the following command to enumerate the vulnerable certificate templates in the CA.

```powershell
PS C:\Temp> .\Certify.exe find /vulnerable

Although `certipy.exe` works really well, but it does need the `.exe` file on a victim's machine, and it can be easily caught by anti-virus programs, so unless you know how to evade AVs, do not use this method, and instead perform enumeration remotely from a linux distribution like Kali or Parrot OS.
